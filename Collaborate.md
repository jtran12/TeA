### Past Meetings

**When:** Every Monday, Friday, 5-6+

**Where:** Bahen (Great Hall, BA1200, and when desperate, the hallways), Gernstein booked rooms

**Total hours met:** Met approximately 8 hours total in the span of the last three weeks.

#### January 30th
Everyone met and introduced themselves to the team. This meeting's purpose was briefly figuring out which project to work on (TA coordination application or an idea of our own), and figuring out what experiences/skills each team member had. We also established our own development method with one member being the general team leader, one member being the back-end leader and one member being the front-end leader. This was chosen to not only improve communication but organization as well. Keeping track of what 3/4 members are doing is much more efficient than keeping track of all 7. The back-end and front-end leader would communicate with each other on the integration of both portions.

Estimated time: ~30 minutes

#### February 3rd
Everyone met up once more to discuss how to split up the TA selection system into services and what our team/learning goals are. Each point in the use cases and it's corresponding implementation was discussed. The team leader then discussed our ideas with the TA in order to receive feedback on how to improve them. Furthermore, the team also discussed a change from the previous platform decided, Django, to Node.js in order to increase compatibility between our API and the back-end framework.

Estimated time: ~1+ hours

#### February 6th
Most of the team was able to make it to the meeting to discuss plans for setting up and hosting the actual application. It was decided to use Heroku (after asking the professor to change our Github repository to public). Additionally, the team began to work on the Swagger documentation. At the end of the meeting, one member was responsible for setting up a server to host the Swagger document so that everyone could work on it simultaneously. However not much could be accomplished without receiving the example JSON format, the format of the database schema, and access to Jira. The team leader was given the task to ask the professor for all the information necessary to plan the API.

Estimated time: ~1+ hours

#### February 10th



#### February 14th
The whole team showed up to finish designing the API and to document it in OpenApi format using Swagger.

Estimated time: 3 hours

### Shared Documents

* Google Docs: [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2AfiEcxOFLsu5fYQ2xPJl1_T3tKH10XBU5hBDyPWY8/edit#heading=h.wcyofgdcqjp1) used primarily for documenting every meeting and discussions (and for documentation on our updates in the future)
* Swagger: The API will be documented here and referred to during development

### Future Meetings
In the future, we plan to have meetings at a booked room in Gernstein for privacy. The plan of meeting every Monday and Friday still stands however more days might be added in between depending on the amount of work left to do.

### Methodology
Our team will be using the Kanban software development methodology for the course of this project. As we have all had experience with Scrum, we decided against it because we felt that the management criteria that would fit best would be "Work in Progress" (WIP). By using this method, we hope to optimize not only the flow of work items but team cooperation as well. Since every column on the Kanban board represents a WIP limit, we can ensure that the whole team will be helping to clear the state bfefore permitting new work items. This allows us to organize our minimum viable product (MVP) better since we will not be working all over the place but in a more organized method. Each state will represent a substantial portion of the application such as a group of use cases.

### Strategy for Dividing Work
For the beginning of the project, we divided the write ups, wireframes, test research and basic application set up (database, server) equally. Designing the API was only done when all group members were present

We divided the team into front-end and back-end groups, 3 and 4 members respectively, by taking into account preferred work and experience. Front-end will split up their goals by assigning each member to work on a specific view. Back-end will split up their goals by assigning one member to work with the database and queries, another member to work with HTTP methods for RESTful APIs and the last two will be working with our recommendation system for TA selection. Lastly, one member will work on taking notes during each meeting and posting them on Google Docs where any member can add details.

### Github
Each member will be responsible for creating tests after each job they completed. Also each member will be working on separate branches and merging with the main only if they have tested and completed the task successfully. 

There will be two CI people in the group that will ensure flawless integration: the front-end leader and the back-end leader. 

### Messaging
* Slack: [Group](https://csc302projectgroup.slack.com/) where most of the discussion, development, and meeting times are posted/pinned
* Facebook/email: General way to contact one another

### Tracking Progress
Since we were all enthusiastic about learning how to use JIRA, we would like to use it to limit WIPs and track story cards, issues and bugs. By keeping track of the Kanban board, we will be able to identify bottlenecks in the progress visually and improve our process in order to avoid them in the future. JIRA will be integrated with Github for ease of use. Since it is able to visualize team performance through flow diagrams and control charts, we will use that to get a good idea of our progress and it will be included in our documentation for reference.
