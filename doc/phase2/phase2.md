# Current Build

- What did you actually build during this phase?
    - How is this different from what you originally proposed? Why?

### Front End

For phase two, we scaffolded a general layout with placeholder data that will be replaced with the data retrieved through a server API. Also, we have begun to implement a data flow structure, namely the flux data architecture presented by Facebook through the form of Redux, one of many unidirectional data flow libraries.

We narrowed the scope of the components we plan to build and focus on, trimming out unnecessary features from our original proposition such as login, signup, term import and creation (unless time permits).

# Product Design
- High-level design of your software.

# Technical Highlights

- Technical highlights: interesting bugs, challenges, lessons learned, observations, etc.

### Front End



# Teamwork
- Reflect on your teamwork and process. What worked well, what  needs improvement.
    - Ideally you will have specific artifacts from your development process to show (for instance, a burndown chart)

# Triage
- What will you build for phase 3, the final demo?
