# Scope

### TA Coordinator Use Cases

Given the short time frame, we have decided to focus on the TA coordinator use cases (all 18 of them). The TA coordinator uses the app more than anybody else, also, the flaws of the current app are more of a burden for the TA coordinator than it for anybody else. For that reason, as well as the limited timeframe, the team is focusing on making life easier for the TA coordinator.

### Assumptions about the Applicant Endpoint
While designing and implementing solutions for the TA coordinator use cases, we would work under the assumption that all the applicant use cases have been implemented and that we have all the required data from the applicant side to use on the TA coordinator side.

As previously mentioned, the team has decided to provide solutions for all 18 TA coord use cases, we also decided to design and implement a recommendation system to assist with TA assignments.

### Recommendation System

Karen Reid mentioned some "rules" she has to follow when considering which applicants to assign to a course, for example in some cases she had to prioritize graduate applicants over undergraduate applicants, applicants in the department of computer science over applicants from other departments. We plan to build a recommendation system that for each course, it makes recommendations to the TA coordinator on which applicants to assign, prioritizing based on the previously mentioned "rules".

### Learning Goals

The recurring theme regarding learning goals is to gain some experience working with languages and frameworks that are in very high demand in todayâ€™s job market. We are also working on our ability to take simple user stories and turn them into software solutions that perfectly satisfies what the user had in mind. Finally, we will be following the Kanban workflow methodology, a first for some of us. The experience working in a Kanban team would be a great reference point when considering its pros and cons in our future endeavours.
